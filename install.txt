Here's how to set up the project:

If you're on Windows:
	run the SetupSDLWindows.bat to install SDL2
	then run visualstudiosetup.bat to automatically download and use premake5 to setup a visual studio solution with SDL already linked. 

If you're on Linux: [EXPERIMENTAL]
	You'll need to have cmake and premake5. get those and install SDL2. see linuxreadme.txt for help if you need it.
	Honestly I doubt u will, since SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_ttf are the only dependencies. the premake5.lua script
	SOULD setup a cmake to compile and move the data/ to be next to the executable.
